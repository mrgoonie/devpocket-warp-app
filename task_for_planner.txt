Task: Fix Flutter analyzer warnings for unused variables and fields

Current issue:
- 6 unused_local_variable warnings
- 3 unused_field warnings

Requirements:
1. Run Flutter analyzer to identify specific unused variables and fields
2. Review each warning to determine if variable/field should be:
   - Removed (if truly unused)
   - Prefixed with underscore (if intentionally unused)
   - Actually used (if it was meant to be used)
3. Fix all warnings while maintaining functionality
4. Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality

Acceptance Criteria:
- Flutter analyzer shows 0 unused_local_variable warnings
- Flutter analyzer shows 0 unused_field warnings
- All tests pass after fixes
- No functionality is broken

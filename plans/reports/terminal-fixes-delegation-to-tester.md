2. **Block Display**: Removed expansion/collapse, made blocks fixed height
3. **Settings Integration**: Already properly connected to terminalModeProvider
4. **Welcome Blocks**: Changed to always use scrollable layout
5. **Action Buttons**: Stop button and copy buttons already implemented
6. **Fullscreen Modal**: Improved error handling and integration

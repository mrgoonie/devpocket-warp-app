# Testing Delegation: Terminal Screen Refactoring Validation

## Task Summary
**Objective**: Validate the completed Terminal screen refactoring implementation across all 6 phases

**Scope**: Comprehensive testing of Terminal screen functionality including build validation, syntax checking, and functional testing

**Critical Context**: 
- The flutter-mobile-dev agent has completed all 6 phases of the Terminal screen refactoring implementation plan
- Key modifications include Vaults screen changes, Terminal screen flow updates, Terminal block features, view switching, interactive commands, and copy/clear features
- Need to ensure no regressions and all new functionality works as expected

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/screens/terminal/enhanced_terminal_screen.dart`
- `/lib/screens/vaults/vaults_screen.dart`  
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/ssh_terminal_widget.dart`
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/enhanced_terminal_block.dart`
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/fullscreen_terminal_modal.dart`

**Testing Requirements**:

### Build and Syntax Validation
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for any analysis issues
- Run `flutter build ios --debug` to ensure iOS build compiles
- Check for any compilation errors or warnings

### Functional Testing Areas
1. **Vaults Screen Changes**: Verify hosts tab removal and sync controls migration
2. **Terminal Screen Flow**: Test Select SSH Host initial state and navigation
3. **Terminal Block Features**: Validate command type detection and controls
4. **Terminal View Switching**: Test Block â†” Terminal view functionality  
5. **Interactive Commands**: Verify fullscreen modal fixes
6. **Copy/Clear Features**: Test new functionality

### Testing Strategy
- Static analysis and compilation checks
- Widget tree validation
- State management verification
- Error handling validation
- UI/UX flow testing

**Success Criteria**:
- All builds compile successfully without errors
- No analysis issues or critical warnings
- All functional areas pass validation
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Clean summary report with actionable recommendations

**Reference Files**: 
- Implementation plan files in `./plans` directory
- Modified source files listed above
- Test files in `/test` directory

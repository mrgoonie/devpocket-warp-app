## Scope
Fix 15+ critical terminal issues across multiple files to restore full terminal functionality.

## Critical Context
- Only 3 out of 18+ terminal features are currently working
- Multiple disconnected implementations need integration
- Terminal blocks, AppBar logic, fullscreen modal all broken
- User experience severely impacted

## Reference Files
- **Plan**: `/Users/duynguyen/www/devpocket-warp-app/plans/20250827-terminal-implementation-critical-fixes-plan.md`
- **Main Screen**: `/Users/duynguyen/www/devpocket-warp-app/lib/screens/terminal/enhanced_terminal_screen.dart`

- Ensure robust error handling throughout
- Follow existing architectural patterns
- Use Riverpod providers properly
- Maintain code quality standards

## Expected Output
Detailed implementation report covering:
- Completed phases with file changes
- Technical decisions and integration points
- Any issues encountered and resolutions
- Testing performed and results

# Task Delegation: Test RenderFlex Overflow Fix

## Agent: tester

## Task Context
Validate the RenderFlex overflow fix implemented in the native terminal view. The fix involved adding `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to the Column widget in `_buildXtermFallbackContent()` method.

## Reference Documents
- **Implementation Report**: `/plans/reports/renderbox-overflow-fix-implementation-report.md`
- **Original Plan**: `/plans/20250127-terminal-comprehensive-fixes-plan.md` (Phase 2, Task 4)

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Compilation & Basic Validation
- Run Flutter analysis to ensure no regressions
- Validate that the build succeeds
- Check for any new warnings or errors

### 2. Terminal Widget Tests
Focus on testing terminal-related functionality:
- SSH terminal integration tests
- Terminal session persistence tests
- Widget rendering tests (if available)

### 3. Layout Constraint Tests
If possible, create focused tests to validate:
- Column widget sizing behavior
- Expanded widget constraint handling
- No overflow conditions in constrained layouts

## Expected Outcomes
- ✅ All existing tests should pass
- ✅ No new compilation errors or warnings
- ✅ Terminal functionality remains intact
- ✅ Layout rendering validates successfully

## Key Files Modified
- `lib/widgets/terminal/ssh_terminal_widget.dart` (line 729)

## Success Criteria
1. No test regressions from the layout fix
2. Terminal integration tests pass
3. No Flutter analysis warnings introduced
4. Build process completes successfully

Please run comprehensive tests and provide a detailed summary report of:
- Test execution results
- Any failures or issues found
- Validation of the fix effectiveness
- Recommendations for any additional testing needed

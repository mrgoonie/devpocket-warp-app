- ✅ Updated Riverpod provider imports for sync state management
- ✅ Added sync status indicator in AppBar with conflict handling

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/screens/terminal/enhanced_terminal_screen.dart`

### ✅ Phase 2: Vaults Screen Restructuring  
**Objective**: Remove Hosts tab from Vaults screen (3 → 2 tabs)

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Updated `TabController` from 3 to 2 tabs
- ✅ Removed Hosts tab definition completely
- ✅ Removed `_buildHostsTab()` method (139+ lines)
- ✅ Updated `TabBarView` children array structure
- ✅ Removed host-related imports and unused methods
- ✅ Cleaned up `_showAddHostDialog` references

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/screens/vaults/vaults_screen.dart`

### ✅ Phase 3: Terminal Screen Enhancement
**Objective**: Enhance terminal screen with consolidated functionality

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Removed `_buildLocalTerminalCard()` method completely
- ✅ Updated host selector to exclude local terminal option
- ✅ Implemented dynamic AppBar logic: "Add Host" when empty, "Select Host" when hosts available
- ✅ Added loading indicator during host connection process
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and user feedback

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/screens/terminal/enhanced_terminal_screen.dart`

### ✅ Phase 4: Terminal View Switching Fix
**Objective**: Fix terminal view mode switching functionality

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Fixed `_buildStatusBar()` icon logic in `ssh_terminal_widget.dart`
- ✅ Corrected icon display logic (removed unnecessary conditional)
- ✅ Implemented proper Terminal view (Termius-style) functionality
- ✅ Enhanced Terminal view with welcome message integration
- ✅ Ensured correct icon switching between Block/Terminal views

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/ssh_terminal_widget.dart`

### ✅ Phase 5: Enhanced Terminal Block Features
**Objective**: Improve terminal block functionality and command handling

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Enhanced command type detection with all ProcessType cases:
  - One Shot, Persistent, REPL, Dev Server, Watcher, Interactive, Build Tool
- ✅ Improved UI display for different command types with tooltips
- ✅ Added copy functionality for both commands and output
- ✅ Added clear functionality to wipe all terminal blocks with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Enhanced process indicators with better visual feedback

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/enhanced_terminal_block.dart`
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/ssh_terminal_widget.dart`

### ✅ Phase 6: Interactive Command Modal Fix
**Objective**: Fix fullscreen modal for interactive commands

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Enhanced initialization order and error handling
- ✅ Added proper timing delays for terminal readiness
- ✅ Improved service initialization with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Added mounted state checks throughout the modal lifecycle
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting and user feedback

**Key Files Modified**:
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/fullscreen_terminal_modal.dart`

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Improvements
- **State Management**: Proper Riverpod integration across all components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Loading indicators and optimized state updates
- **User Experience**: Intuitive navigation and visual feedback

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **Dynamic AppBar**: Context-aware actions based on host availability
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during host connections
- **Copy Functionality**: Easy-to-access command and output copying
- **Clear Functionality**: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- **Process Indicators**: Rich visual feedback for different command types

### Code Quality
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between UI, state, and business logic
- **Reusability**: Modular widgets and services
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented code with clear naming conventions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and errors

## Files Successfully Modified

### Core Screen Files
- `/lib/screens/terminal/enhanced_terminal_screen.dart` - Major refactoring
- `/lib/screens/vaults/vaults_screen.dart` - Restructuring and cleanup

### Widget Components  
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/ssh_terminal_widget.dart` - View switching and clear functionality
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/enhanced_terminal_block.dart` - Command type detection and copy features
- `/lib/widgets/terminal/fullscreen_terminal_modal.dart` - Modal fixes and improvements

## Testing Status

- **Unit Level**: All changes follow existing patterns and conventions
- **Integration Level**: Proper state management and provider integration
- **User Experience**: Enhanced feedback and error handling
- **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of controllers and subscriptions
- **State Updates**: Optimized setState calls with mounted checks
- **Loading States**: Non-blocking UI with appropriate feedback
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup in dispose methods

## Security & Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Proper handling of user inputs
- **State Protection**: Mounted checks before state updates
- **Error Exposure**: User-friendly error messages without sensitive data
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of streams and controllers

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Testing**: Run comprehensive integration tests on all modified components
2. **Code Review**: Conduct thorough code review for any missed edge cases
3. **User Testing**: Validate the new flow with end users

### Future Enhancements

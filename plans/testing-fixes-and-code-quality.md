# Testing Environment Fixes and Code Quality Improvements

## Issues Identified
1. **Timer disposal issues in splash screen**: Multiple untracked timers causing widget test failures
2. **52 linting warnings**: Deprecated APIs, missing const constructors, unused fields
3. **SSH key serialization**: Field naming inconsistency ('KEY' vs 'key')

## Implementation Strategy
- Fix timer management and disposal in splash screen
- Address all linting warnings systematically  
- Ensure API compatibility for SSH operations
- Run comprehensive tests to verify fixes

## Success Criteria
- All widget tests pass without timer failures
- Flutter analyze shows 0 critical issues
- SSH functionality works correctly
- No functional regressions

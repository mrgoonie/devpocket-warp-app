```

### Key Components
- **Terminal Block Manager**: Orchestrates block creation, updates, and lifecycle management
- **Fullscreen Interactive Modal (PTY)**: Handles vi, nano, top, htop and other interactive commands
- **AI Mode State Provider**: Maintains mode persistence across sessions using Riverpod
- **Text Encoding Handler**: Resolves UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion and font rendering issues
- **Auto-scroll Controller**: Manages intelligent scrolling behavior

### Data Models
- **TerminalBlockData**: Enhanced with interactive state, encoding flags, and modal triggers
- **InteractiveCommandSession**: Manages fullscreen modal state and command lifecycle
- **TerminalSessionState**: Tracks AI mode, scroll position, and active sessions

## Implementation Approaches Analysis

### Approach 1: Incremental Refactor with Enhanced Terminal Screen
**Architecture**: Build upon existing `enhanced_terminal_screen.dart`, gradually replacing functionality

**Pros**:
- Lower risk by preserving existing working functionality
- Easier testing and validation of individual components
- Maintains current SSH connection patterns
- Less disruption to existing users

**Cons**:
- Still requires careful cleanup of old implementation
- May carry forward some architectural debt
- Slower to achieve full vision of new terminal experience
- Risk of feature parity gaps during transition

### Approach 2: Complete Terminal Rebuild with Modern Architecture
**Architecture**: Fresh implementation using latest Flutter patterns, xterm.dart integration

**Pros**:
- Clean slate allows optimal architecture decisions
- Direct integration with xterm.dart for better terminal emulation
- Modern Riverpod patterns for state management
- Opportunity to implement best practices from ground up

**Cons**:
- Higher development risk and time investment
- Requires comprehensive testing of all terminal functionality
- Potential for regression in SSH connection features
- More complex migration path for existing features

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach - Core Rebuild with Incremental Migration
**Architecture**: New terminal core with strategic migration of proven components

**Pros**:
- Balanced risk/reward profile
- Allows leveraging proven SSH connection logic
- Enables modern architecture for new features
- Provides clear migration path for features

**Cons**:
- Requires careful interface design between old/new components
- Complex integration testing scenarios
- Risk of architectural inconsistencies
- May require temporary compatibility layers

## Recommended Approach: Hybrid Core Rebuild

**Justification**: The hybrid approach provides the best balance of innovation and stability. We can build a modern terminal core while preserving critical SSH functionality, then incrementally migrate features. This minimizes user disruption while achieving our architectural goals.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation and Cleanup (Est: 3 days)
**Scope**: Remove old implementation, establish new core architecture

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Delete `lib/screens/terminal/terminal_screen.dart` - file: `lib/screens/terminal/terminal_screen.dart`
2. [ ] Create enhanced terminal session manager - file: `lib/services/enhanced_terminal_session_manager.dart`
3. [ ] Implement terminal block data model improvements - file: `lib/models/enhanced_terminal_models.dart`
4. [ ] Create AI mode persistence provider using Riverpod - file: `lib/providers/terminal_mode_provider.dart`
5. [ ] Establish text encoding handler service - file: `lib/services/terminal_text_encoding_service.dart`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Old terminal implementation completely removed without breaking SSH functionality
- [ ] New terminal session manager handles basic command execution
- [ ] AI mode persists across app restarts and navigation
- [ ] Text encoding service properly handles UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion

### Phase 2: Terminal Block UI Enhancements (Est: 4 days)

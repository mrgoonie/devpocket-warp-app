## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests with Spot Framework
- **Modern Selectors**: Use `spot<Widget>()` instead of traditional `find` methods
- **Automatic Screenshots**: Capture visual state on test failures
- **Timeline Reports**: Generate HTML reports for debugging complex test scenarios
- **Chained Assertions**: Improved readability with method chaining

### WebSocket Testing Approach
- **Mock-First Strategy**: Test app logic without external WebSocket dependencies
- **State Simulation**: Mock connection states, message flows, and error conditions
- **Performance Validation**: Ensure WebSocket operations meet timing requirements
- **Error Recovery Testing**: Validate graceful handling of connection issues

### CI/CD Integration Tests
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure CI environment matches local development setup
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimize test execution time through parallel processing
- **Artifact Validation**: Verify build outputs meet quality standards
- **Deployment Readiness**: Automated checks ensure production deployment safety

## Security Considerations

- [ ] **Test Data Security**: Ensure test credentials don't leak in CI logs
- [ ] **Mock Service Isolation**: WebSocket mocks don't expose real endpoints
- [ ] **Build Environment Security**: Android SDK and dependencies from trusted sources
- [ ] **CI/CD Security**: Encrypted environment variables for sensitive configuration
- [ ] **Test Execution Isolation**: Integration tests don't interfere with each other

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Spot framework compatibility issues | Medium | Thorough compatibility testing, fallback to traditional testing if needed |
| WebSocket mock complexity | High | Start with simple mocks, incrementally add complexity |
| CI/CD pipeline configuration errors | High | Test pipeline locally using act or similar tools |
| Android SDK version conflicts | Medium | Use specific SDK versions, document requirements clearly |
| Test execution environment differences | Medium | Docker containers for consistent test environments |
